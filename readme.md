## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 1 - Activity Stream Assignment

### Assignment Step Description

As a first step in building our Activity Stream messaging application, we will create a monolithic application. 
**A monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application in which the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform. 
A monolithic application is self-contained and independent from other computing applications.**

### Problem Statement

In this case study: Activity Stream Step 1, we will develop a monolithic application which will get the sender name, message from the user using a form (JSP/HTML), 
persist in MySQL Database and display all messages with their sender name, message content, timestamp of posting in a reverse chronological order (latest message first).

### Expected solution

### Following are the broad tasks:

### Project structure

The folders and files you see in this repositories, is how it is expected to be in projects, which are submitted for automated evaluation by Hobbes

> PS: All lint rule files are by default copied during the evaluation process, however if need to be customizing, you should copy from this repo and modify in your project repo


#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step1** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-dev.stackroute.in/activity-stream-java/step1-boilerplate.git assignment-solution-step1`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step6 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step1`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step1` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab.training.com/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step1.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed

### Important instructions for Participants
> - We expect you to write the assignment on your own by following through the guidelines, learning plan, and the practice exercises
> - The code must not be plagirized, the mentors will randomly pick the submissions and may ask you to explain the solution
> - The code must be properly indented, code structure maintained as per the boilerplate and properly commented
> - Follow through the problem statement shared with you

### Further Instructions on Release
